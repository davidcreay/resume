  opening: >
    I am writing to apply for the AWS Security & Vulnerability Remediation Engineer position. 
    I offer 16 years of experience in AWS architecture and am currently completing an MSc in Cyber Security 
    with the Open University.
  body: >
    In my recent contract at Tabled Technologies, I spearheaded infrastructure remediation to achieve 
    ISO27001 and SOC2 compliance; managing the audit lifecycle, engaging with auditors to close 
    cross-account technical gaps, architecting security policies, and implementing technical controls.

    description: >
      Led end-to-end AWS vulnerability remediation and infrastructure hardening to achieve ISO27001 
      compliance. Managed the full vulnerability lifecycle: triaging Security Hub findings, 
      prioritizing risk via CVSS/EPSS, and partnering with developers to implement secure 
      fixes across production delivery pipelines.
    achievements:
      - Successfully remediated critical Internal Audit gaps (A.8.31/A.8.32) to secure Stage 2 certification.
      - Integrated GitOps-based security scanning into GitLab CI/CD, automating IaC vulnerability checks 
        and dependency scanning (Shift-Left).
      - Hardened AWS workload security by automating Trend Micro agent deployment via SSM and 
        enforcing CloudTrail log integrity for compliance auditing.
      - Tuned GuardDuty and Security Hub configurations to improve threat detection accuracy and 
        reduce alert fatigue for the engineering team.
    responsibilities:
      - Executing full VPC network segregation, isolating production RDS and compute workloads within 
        private subnets with WAF/Shield protection.
      - Implementing OIDC-based GitLab CI/CD workflows to eliminate long-lived IAM keys and enforce 
        short-lived, least-privilege access.
      - Developing Infrastructure-as-Code (SAM/CloudFormation) to automate the capture of evidence 
        and security metrics for audit reporting.
